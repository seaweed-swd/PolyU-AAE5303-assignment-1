# AAE5303 Environment Setup Report — Template for Students

> **Important:** Follow this structure exactly in your submission README.  
> Your goal is to demonstrate **evidence, process, problem-solving, and reflection** — not only screenshots.

## 1. System Information

**Laptop model:**  
My laptop is acer swift3 with i5-1135G7@4core and 16g ram and 7.72g avaliable storage, hence it is impossible for using Docker and Container in the device (I have used it before in my PC so am able to estimate the possibility and draw the conclusion). So I have to use a rented cloud service for the task, and finally select AutoDL (https://www.autodl.com/) with a instance (actually a docker container based on ubuntu22.04 and could install packages) that may fit the following tasks request with pytorch-gpu etc..

**CPU / RAM:**  
16 vCPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8352V CPU @ 2.10GHz / 120GB RAM

**Host OS:**  
Ubuntu 22.04

**Linux/ROS environment type:**  
_[Choose one:]_
- [ ] Dual-boot Ubuntu
- [ ] WSL2 Ubuntu
- [ ] Ubuntu in VM (UTM/VirtualBox/VMware/Parallels)
- [ ] Docker container
- [ ] Lab PC
- [x] Remote Linux server

## 2. Python Environment Check

### 2.1 Steps Taken

Describe briefly how you created/activated your Python environment:

**Tool used:**  
_[venv / conda / system Python]_

**Key commands you ran:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Any deviations from the default instructions:**  
I used conda before with routhly steps of: 1)download anaconda or miniconda; 2)use conda prompt for the command 'conda creat -n python=xx.xx'; 3)'activate -n' the venv and install packages; 4)find the interpreter in ide and use the venv (need to add environment variable in win10, and may need a CUDA or cudatookit package)

But it is easy and enjoy for complete these complex steps by rent a cloud service, just recharge the AutoDL platform, select a instance and start, use remote ssh to connect the instant (container) in IDE (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BtpEzxENN).

### 2.2 Test Results

Run these commands and paste the actual terminal output (not just screenshots):

```bash
python scripts/test_python_env.py
```

**Output:**
```
[Paste your actual terminal output here]
```

```bash
python scripts/test_open3d_pointcloud.py
```

**Output:**
```
[Paste your actual terminal output here]
```

**Screenshot:**  
_[Include one screenshot showing both tests passing]_

## 3. ROS 2 Workspace Check

### 3.1 Build the workspace

Paste the build output summary (final lines only):

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
```

**Expected output:**
```
Summary: 1 package finished [x.xx s]
```

**Your actual output:**
```
[Paste your build summary here]
```

### 3.2 Run talker and listener

Show both source commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```

**Then run talker:**
```bash
ros2 run env_check_pkg talker.py
```

**Output (3–4 lines):**
```
[Paste 3-4 lines of talker output here]
```

**Run listener:**
```bash
ros2 run env_check_pkg listener.py
```

**Output (3–4 lines):**
```
[Paste 3-4 lines of listener output here]
```

**Alternative (using launch file):**
```bash
ros2 launch env_check_pkg env_check.launch.py
```

**Screenshot:**  
_[Include one screenshot showing talker + listener running]_

## 4. Problems Encountered and How I Solved Them

> **Note:** Write 2–3 issues, even if small. This section is crucial — it demonstrates understanding and problem-solving.

### Issue 1: [Write the exact error message or problem]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[Explain what you think caused it]_

**Fix:**  
_[The exact command/config change you used to solve it]_

```bash
[Your fix command/code here]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Official ROS docs? StackOverflow? AI assistant? Something else?]_

---

### Issue 2: [Another real error or roadblock]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[Explain what you think caused it]_

**Fix:**  
_[The exact command/config change you used to solve it]_

```bash
[Your fix command/code here]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Official ROS docs? StackOverflow? AI assistant? Something else?]_

---

### Issue 3 (Optional): [Title]

**Cause / diagnosis:**  
_[Explain what you think caused it]_

**Fix:**  
_[The exact command/config change you used to solve it]_

```bash
[Your fix command/code here]
```

**Reference:**  
_[Official ROS docs? StackOverflow? AI assistant? Something else?]_

## 5. Use of Generative AI (Required)

Choose one of the issues above and document how you used AI to solve it.

> **Goal:** Show critical use of AI, not blind copying.

### 5.1 Exact prompt you asked

**Your prompt:**
```
[Copy-paste your actual message to the AI, not a summary]
```

### 5.2 Key helpful part of the AI's answer

**AI's response (relevant part only):**
```
[Quote only the relevant part of the AI's answer]
```

### 5.3 What you changed or ignored and why

Explain briefly:
- Did the AI recommend something unsafe?
- Did you modify its solution?
- Did you double-check with official docs?

**Your explanation:**  
_[Write your analysis here]_

### 5.4 Final solution you applied

Show the exact command or file edit that fixed the problem:

```bash
[Your final command/code here]
```

**Why this worked:**  
_[Brief explanation]_

## 6. Reflection (3–5 sentences)

Short but thoughtful:

- What did you learn about configuring robotics environments?
- What surprised you?
- What would you do differently next time (backup, partitioning, reading error logs, asking better AI questions)?
- How confident do you feel about debugging ROS/Python issues now?

**Your reflection:**

_[Write your 3-5 sentence reflection here]_

## 7. Declaration

✅ **I confirm that I performed this setup myself and all screenshots/logs reflect my own environment.**

**Name:**  
_[Your name]_

**Student ID:**  
_[Your student ID]_

**Date:**  
_[Date of submission]_
